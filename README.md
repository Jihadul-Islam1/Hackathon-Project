# Ethanol-Blended Petrol: A Sustainable Energy Solution

## Overview
Ethanol-Blended Petrol is a project aimed at addressing critical challenges in Bangladesh's energy and environmental sectors by leveraging agricultural waste to produce ethanol. This ethanol is then blended with petrol to create E10 fuel, a cleaner, more affordable, and sustainable energy alternative.

---

## Features
- Utilizes agricultural waste like sugarcane bagasse, rice husks, and corn stalks.
- Produces E10 fuel (10% ethanol and 90% petrol) compatible with existing vehicles.
- Supports local farmers and promotes energy independence.
- Reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves air quality.

---

## Benefits
1. **Economic:**
   - Lowers fuel costs.
   - Provides farmers with additional income by selling agricultural waste.
   - Saves foreign reserves by reducing fuel imports.
2. **Environmental:**
   - Decreases reliance on fossil fuels.
   - Emits fewer greenhouse gases, promoting a cleaner environment.
3. **Energy Independence:**
   - Reduces dependency on global fuel markets.
   - Enhances Bangladesh's energy security.

## Production Process
1. **Feedstock Collection:**
   Agricultural by-products such as rice husks, sugarcane bagasse, and corn stalks are gathered.
2. **Pre-treatment:**
   The biomass is processed to release cellulose.
3. **Enzymatic Hydrolysis:**
   Cellulose is broken down into simple sugars using enzymes.
4. **Fermentation:**
   Microorganisms convert the sugars into ethanol.
5. **Distillation and Purification:**
   Ethanol is purified for blending.
6. **Blending:**
   Ethanol is mixed with petrol to create E10 fuel, which is distributed through existing fuel stations.
